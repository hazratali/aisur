The MIUA conference is a premier UK-based conference in medical imaging, organized and supported by the [British Machine Vision Association](https://www.bmva.org/).

The meeting is designed for the dissemination and discussion of research in medical image understanding and analysis, and aims to encourage the growth and raise the profile of this multi-disciplinary field by bringing together the various communities.
